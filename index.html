Inspired by the work he did and the people he touched, we are organizing recurring hackathons at <a href="http://aaronswartzhackathon.org">locations all over the world</a> in memory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz">Aaron Swartz</a>. The next set will be synchronized on the weekend of November 8-10, 2013. The event will bring together the varied communities that Aaron touched to figure out how the important problems of the world connect, and to share the load of working on those problems. 
<h1>The NYC Event</h1>
We will host the event 18:00 Friday to 20:00 Saturday at the Pfizer building at 630 Flushing Ave in Brooklyn:
